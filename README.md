Whether you're delving into the essentials like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, or exploring more advanced topics such as cultivating a developer mindset, mastering the command line interface, and navigating Git for version control, this hub has you covered. Dive into the carefully curated content to gain insights, tips, and hands-on experience. Follow the structured learning path, and don't forget to explore the practical aspects like working with arrays and contributing to GitHub repositories through branches and pull requests.

For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.

Happy coding, and may your journey into the world of front end development be both enlightening and rewarding!

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
